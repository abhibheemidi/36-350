cat("Hello Aliens (if that's what you go by)! I am a human living on a planet similar to yours called 'Earth'. 
    I am reaching out on behalf of humanity to broker an agreement of neutrality between our two planets. 
    How is life on your planet, and how much variation do you see across different species of flora and fauna? 
    I'm curious about your planet's way of life given that your days are shorter/longer and 
    your planet could have multiple moons.")
